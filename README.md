# anime-downloader

This downloader was just a quick hack out of desperation but is up and working with a few hickups at the moment.
Any help with this project would be greatly appriciated!!

Ok so how does it work?

simple! Just install the requirements with:

pip3 install requirements.txt
(or just pip if you prefer)

then run:
python3 selenium_scraper.py

This will initiate the script and once logged in you will be asked for the anime you would like to download 

IMPORTANT!!
This is still just a quick hacked together downloader 
when entering the anime name ensure it is all lowercase and no special characters are added otherwise it will not work
for example:
'To LOVE-Ru' would be 'to love ru'
updates will come with an emproved parsing and search function as to minimize failures.

If you have any suggestions as to how I can emprocve this downloader or if you would like to add any funtionality please make a pull request and I would be more than happy to work with you!
